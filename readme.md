# Information Security Career Paths roadmap

A quick visual guide of the major career paths and domains in cybersecurity / information security.

## Notes and improvements

This is not a comprehensive list: information security is a massive space with dozens to hundreds of niches.

This aims to provide a broad overview of the major categories, to not overwhelm beginners like most of the charts out there.

**Improvements?**

- You can extend this list by adding an issue. I'll do my best to incorporate it into the map, if it fits.
