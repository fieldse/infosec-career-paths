## Notes and improvements

This is by no means an exhaustive list of all the roles out there. Information security is a massive space with dozens to hundreds of niches.

This aims to provide a broad overview of the major categories, to not overwhelm beginners like most of the charts out there.

**Improvements?**

You can extend this list by [adding an issue](https://github.com/fieldse/infosec-career-paths/issues/new). I'll do my best to incorporate it into the map, if it fits the scope.
